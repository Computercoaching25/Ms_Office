    <h2>Passage: Tolerance</h2>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        Tolerance is the special need of the day in India because of the diversity present here. There are thirty-six States and Union Territories. Indians follow more than six religions, with each religion having several sub-sects. They speak more than 22 officially recognised languages. Even when they speak the same language, English for example, the accent in northern India is different from the one in southern India. People follow different dress codes and different social customs. They have different food habits and celebrate their festivals with a distinct local flavour. This cultural diversity not only adds to the richness of India but can also be an instant flashpoint. So, we need to practice tolerance more than any other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tolerance may simply be defined as ‘putting up with what we do not like’. It is a rather passive quality because it demands no action. But it is a heavenly virtue because it is the only way to achieve peace and harmony in the world. We must realise that if there had been more tolerance, there would have been no wars. Human society would have been far more advanced than what it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us read an interesting incident from the life of Saint Eknath who was known for his tolerance. One day Eknath was returning to his hut after an early morning dip in the holy Ganga. A wicked neighbour lay in wait for him. He climbed up a tree and just when Eknath passed by, he spat on him. The saint went back for a bath without a word to the neighbour. Again, the wicked man repeated his prank. Anyone in Eknath’s place would have got angry but Eknath kept his cool. He returned to the river for another dip. It is said that the wicked man spat on Eknath more than a dozen times but Eknath did not react.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the wicked man felt ashamed of his deed and fell at Eknath’s feet, asking for forgiveness. Eknath smiled and thanked him for the opportunity of having a holy dip more than a dozen times. “This episode has helped me to become a better human being,” said Saint Eknath.
