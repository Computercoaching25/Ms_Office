    <h2>Passage</h2>
    <p>
      I felt shy and half-paralysed in the presence of a crowd. My first day at the new school made me the laughing stock of the classroom. I was sent to the blackboard to write my name and address. I knew my name and address, knew how to write it, knew how to spell it; but standing at the blackboard with the eyes of so many boys and girls staring at my back made me freeze inside. I was unable to write a single letter.<br><br>
      “Write your name,” the teacher called out to me. I lifted the white chalk to the blackboard. But my mind suddenly went blank, empty! I could not remember my name, not even the first letter. Somebody giggled behind me and I became stiff. “Just forget about all of us and write your name on the blackboard,” said the teacher. A wish to write flashed through me but my hand refused to move. The children began to mock at me and my face turned red in shame. The teacher asked gently, “Don’t you know your name?” I looked at her but could not say a word. Smiling at me to give me confidence, the teacher placed her hand on my shoulder.<br><br>
      “What’s your name?” she asked.<br>
      “Richard,” I whispered.<br>
      “Richard what?”<br>
      “Richard Wright,”<br>
      “Spell it” I spelled my name in a wild rush of letters.<br>
      “Spell it slowly so I can hear it,” she said. I did. “Now can you write?” she asked. I nodded. Again I turned to the blackboard and lifted my hand to write. BUT once again I was blank and void within. I was thinking of the girls and boys behind me so I couldn’t think or feel anything else. I grew weak and to prevent a fall, leaned my forehead against the blackboard. The room burst into a loud laughter. The teacher asked me to go back to my seat. I sat and cursed myself. Why did I become so nervous in a crowd? I could read and write better than anyone else, why did strange faces make me freeze?
